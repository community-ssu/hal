      hotplugging (Closes: #446851).
    - Correctly initializes the dbus error struct in the acpi addon
      (Closes: #438802).

    hal-device-manager has been removed from the upstream tarball. There is
    now a separate project called gnome-device-manager which is intended to

    - Replace Suggests: hal-device-manager with gnome-device-manager.
    - Use the new "Homepage:" field to specify the upstream URL.

      hal-setup-keymap binary that is necessary for the multimedia key
      re-mapping support.
    - Add a Recommends: libsmbios-bin [i386 amd64]. The libsmbios-bin
      package ships the dellWirelessCtl utility which is required for the
      RF kill switch support on DELL laptops.
    - Add a Depends: pm-utils. Beginning with this release we will only
      support pm-utils as suspend infrastructure.
    - Add a versioned Depends on mount (>= 2.13). This is a requirement of the
      hal umount helper.

    - Bump shlibs to >= 0.5.10 due to ABI additions.
  * debian/hal.install
    - Install the hal-setup-keymap binary.
    - Install the hal umount helper to /usr/sbin as it has dependencies on
      libraries in /usr/lib.

    - As we only support pm-utils, these patches have become obsolete and are
      thus removed.
  * debian/patches/55_nonpolkit-mount-policy.patch
    - Rework patch for this hal version. Throw a Volume.PermissionDenied error
      if a non-removable device is mounted by a user other than root.

  [ Sebastian Dröge ]
  * debian/patches/68_alternative-cdrw-capacity-detection.patch
    - Add an alternative method of detecting the capacity of CDR/CDRW discs.
